# iris_data
 hello everyone 

i am happy to announce my project in machine & deep learning



about notebook:

In this notebook we will look into famous dataset which is iris, we will analyse the dataset with plotly library which is very interactive library in python then later we will apply different macine learning algorithms and see the best accuracy.



describtion:

The Iris dataset includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. 

One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.



The columns in this dataset are:

- Id

- SepalLengthCm

- SepalWidthCm

- PetalLengthCm

- PetalWidthCm

- Species



steps:

•Load Dataset

(Visualize the dataset)

• Types of species

•Correlation between features

•Visualizing species based on sepal length and width

•Visualizing species based on petal length and width

• Values distribution based on petal width

• Values distribution based on petal length

• Andrew curves



• Linear regression based on sepal

• Linear regression based on petal
